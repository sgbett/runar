# Compiler Architecture

This document describes the internal architecture of the TSOP compiler for contributors and anyone who wants to understand how TypeScript smart contracts are transformed into Bitcoin Script.

---

## Nanopass Overview

The TSOP compiler is structured as six small, composable passes. Each pass does one thing, transforms one intermediate representation (IR) into the next, and is small enough to audit in a single sitting. This design is based on the nanopass framework (Sarkar, Waddell & Dybvig, ICFP 2004).

```
.tsop.ts --> [Parse] --> [Validate] --> [Type-check] --> [ANF Lower] --> [Stack Lower] --> [Emit]
source       Pass 1       Pass 2         Pass 3           Pass 4          Pass 5          Pass 6
            ~150 LOC     ~120 LOC       ~200 LOC         ~180 LOC        ~160 LOC        ~100 LOC
```

Each pass lives in its own file under `packages/tsop-compiler/src/passes/`:

| File | Pass | Input | Output |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| `01-parse.ts` | Parse | `.tsop.ts` source | TSOP AST |
| `02-validate.ts` | Validate | TSOP AST | Validated AST |
| `03-typecheck.ts` | Type-check | Validated AST | Typed AST |
| `04-anf-lower.ts` | ANF Lower | Typed AST | ANF IR |
| `05-stack-lower.ts` | Stack Lower | ANF IR | Stack IR |
| `slh-dsa-codegen.ts` | SLH-DSA Codegen | (called by Pass 5) | Stack IR fragment |
| `06-emit.ts` | Emit | Stack IR | Bitcoin Script (hex) |

The key benefit of this approach: each pass can be tested and verified in isolation. You can unit-test Pass 4 without caring about Passes 1-3, and you can swap out Pass 1 entirely (as the Go and Rust compilers do) while keeping Passes 4-6.

---

## Pass 1: Parse

**File:** `packages/tsop-compiler/src/passes/01-parse.ts`
**Input:** Raw `.tsop.ts` source string
**Output:** TSOP AST (defined in `tsop-ir-schema`)

The parser uses **ts-morph** (a wrapper around the TypeScript compiler API) to parse the source file into a TypeScript AST, then extracts the TSOP-relevant structure: the class declaration, properties, constructor, and methods.

### What It Does

1. Parses the source with ts-morph to get a full TypeScript AST.
2. Locates the single class declaration extending `SmartContract`.
3. Extracts property declarations (name, type, readonly flag).
4. Extracts the constructor (parameters, super call, assignments).
5. Extracts method declarations (visibility, parameters, body statements).
6. Builds a TSOP AST node tree.

### Alternative Frontends

The Go compiler uses **tree-sitter** with a TypeScript grammar for parsing. The planned Rust compiler would use **SWC**. All three frontends must produce structurally equivalent TSOP AST nodes. The conformance suite verifies this by checking that all compilers produce byte-identical ANF IR for the same source.

---

## Pass 2: Validate

**File:** `packages/tsop-compiler/src/passes/02-validate.ts`
**Input:** TSOP AST
**Output:** Validated AST (same structure, but guaranteed to satisfy all constraints)

The validation pass enforces the subset rules that distinguish TSOP from general TypeScript. It walks the AST and rejects any construct that is not in the allowed subset.

### Checks Performed

- Exactly one class per file extending `SmartContract` directly.
- No decorators on the class, properties, or methods.
- No generic type parameters.
- Constructor calls `super(...)` as its first statement.
- All properties assigned exactly once in the constructor.
- `super(...)` passes all properties in declaration order.
- Public methods return `void` and end with `assert(...)`.
- Private methods are not recursive (call graph cycle detection).
- For-loop bounds are compile-time constant integers.
- No disallowed statements: `while`, `do-while`, `try/catch`, `switch`, `throw`, `break`, `continue`.
- No disallowed expressions: `new`, arrow functions, template literals, `typeof`, `instanceof`, optional chaining, spread, `await`, `yield`.
- All imports come from allowed TSOP library modules.
- No disallowed types: `number`, `string`, `any`, `unknown`, `null`, `undefined`, dynamic arrays.

Each violation produces a clear error message referencing the source location.

---

## Pass 3: Type-check

**File:** `packages/tsop-compiler/src/passes/03-typecheck.ts`
**Input:** Validated AST
**Output:** Typed AST (every node annotated with its resolved type)

The type checker resolves types for all expressions and enforces the TSOP type system, including subtyping and affine type rules.

### Phases

1. **Declaration collection**: Gather all property types and method signatures.
2. **Constructor checking**: Verify all property assignments type-check correctly.
3. **Method body checking**: For each method, build the type environment (this, parameters, locals) and type-check every statement and expression.
4. **Affine checking**: Verify that `Sig` and `SigHashPreimage` values are consumed at most once. A `SigHashPreimage` passed to `checkPreimage` is marked consumed; using it again is an error.
5. **Whole-program checks**: Verify no recursion in the call graph, verify all loop bounds are compile-time constants.

### Subtyping

The type system has a shallow subtype hierarchy:

- Domain types (`PubKey`, `Sig`, `Sha256`, `Ripemd160`, `Addr`, `SigHashPreimage`) are subtypes of `ByteString`.
- `RabinSig` and `RabinPubKey` are subtypes of `bigint`.
- Widening (subtype to supertype) is implicit. Narrowing requires an explicit cast function.

### Built-in Function Types

Every built-in function (`checkSig`, `hash160`, `sha256`, etc.) has a known signature. The type checker resolves calls to built-ins and verifies argument types match the expected signature.

---

## Pass 4: ANF Lower

**File:** `packages/tsop-compiler/src/passes/04-anf-lower.ts`
**Input:** Typed AST
**Output:** ANF IR (canonical JSON, defined in `tsop-ir-schema`)

This is the most conceptually important pass. It transforms the typed AST into **Administrative Normal Form (ANF)**, where every sub-expression is bound to a named temporary. There are no nested expressions.

### What Is ANF?

In ANF, every intermediate computation gets a name. Consider this TSOP expression:

```typescript
assert(hash160(pubKey) === this.pubKeyHash);
```

After ANF lowering:

```
t0 = load_param("pubKey")
t1 = call("hash160", [t0])
t2 = load_prop("pubKeyHash")
t3 = bin_op("==", t1, t2)
t4 = assert(t3)
```

Each temporary (`t0`, `t1`, ...) is numbered sequentially within each method. The sequence of bindings IS the evaluation order, which is exactly what the stack machine needs.

### Why ANF?

- **ANF vs CPS**: CPS encodes control flow as function calls. Bitcoin Script has no functions, no call stack, and no closures. ANF keeps control flow explicit (`if`/`loop` nodes), which maps directly to `OP_IF`/`OP_ELSE`/`OP_ENDIF`.
- **ANF vs SSA**: SSA requires phi-nodes at control flow join points. The stack scheduling pass needs to know the evaluation order of every value, and ANF provides this directly. SSA would require a separate linearization step.
- **ANF vs raw AST**: Nested expressions create ambiguity about where intermediate values live during stack scheduling. ANF eliminates this by naming every intermediate result.

### Canonicalization

The ANF IR is the **conformance boundary** for the multi-compiler strategy. All compilers must produce byte-identical ANF IR (serialized via RFC 8785 / JCS) for the same source. To ensure this:

- Temporaries are numbered sequentially per method (`t0`, `t1`, ...).
- Sub-expressions are flattened left-to-right.
- Constants are always wrapped in `load_const` (never inlined).
- Short-circuit operators (`&&`, `||`) are lowered to `if` nodes.

### Short-Circuit Lowering Example

`a && b` becomes:

```
t0 = <evaluate a>
t1 = if(t0) {
    t2 = <evaluate b>
    -> t2
} else {
    t3 = load_const(boolean, "false")
    -> t3
}
```

## Pass 5: Stack Lower

**File:** `packages/tsop-compiler/src/passes/05-stack-lower.ts`
**Input:** ANF IR
**Output:** Stack IR (linear sequence of stack instructions)

The stack lowering pass resolves the mismatch between named values in ANF and the nameless stack of Bitcoin Script. It tracks where each value lives on the stack and inserts explicit manipulation instructions (`OP_PICK`, `OP_ROLL`, `OP_SWAP`, `OP_DUP`, etc.) to arrange operands for each operation.

### Stack Scheduling Algorithm

The scheduler maintains a virtual stack and processes bindings in order:

```
for each binding t_i in method body:
  1. Arrange operands on top of stack (using SWAP/ROLL/PICK as needed)
  2. Emit the operation instruction
  3. Result is now on top of stack, labeled t_i
  4. Drop any values whose last use was in this binding
```

### Value Lifetime Analysis

For each ANF temporary, the scheduler computes:

- **Definition point**: Where the value is created.
- **Use points**: All places where the value is consumed.
- **Last use**: The final consumption point.
- **Use count**: How many times the value is referenced.

Values at their last use are moved with `OP_ROLL` (removes the original). Values needed again later are copied with `OP_PICK` (preserves the original).

### Alt-Stack Usage

When a value will not be used for many instructions, the scheduler may move it to the alt-stack (`OP_TOALTSTACK`) and retrieve it later (`OP_FROMALTSTACK`), reducing main-stack depth and avoiding deep `OP_ROLL` operations.

### Depth Tracking

The compiler statically verifies that the stack depth never exceeds 800 items. Both branches of an `OP_IF`/`OP_ELSE`/`OP_ENDIF` must produce the same stack depth at `OP_ENDIF`.

---

## Pass 6: Emit

**File:** `packages/tsop-compiler/src/passes/06-emit.ts`
**Input:** Stack IR
**Output:** Bitcoin Script (hex-encoded byte string)

The emit pass translates each Stack IR instruction into one or more Bitcoin Script opcode bytes.

### Push Data Encoding

Integers and byte strings are encoded using the most compact opcode:

| Value | Encoding |
|-------|----------|
| `0` | `OP_0` (0x00) |
| `1` to `16` | `OP_1` (0x51) to `OP_16` (0x60) |
| `-1` | `OP_1NEGATE` (0x4f) |
| Bytes 1-75 long | `<length_byte> <data>` |
| Bytes 76-255 | `OP_PUSHDATA1 <1-byte-length> <data>` |
| Bytes 256-65535 | `OP_PUSHDATA2 <2-byte-length-LE> <data>` |

### Method Dispatch

For contracts with multiple public methods, the emitter generates a dispatch table using `OP_IF`/`OP_ELSE`/`OP_ENDIF` chains. The unlocking script pushes a method index, and the locking script branches to the correct method body.

### Constructor Parameter Placeholders

Constructor parameters appear as `<paramName>` placeholders in the script template. The SDK replaces them with actual values at deployment time.

### Post-Quantum Signature Codegen (Experimental)

Complex built-in functions like `verifyWOTS` and `verifySLHDSA_SHA2_*` are handled by dedicated codegen modules called from the stack lowerer:

- **WOTS+** (`verifyWOTS`): Inline in `05-stack-lower.ts`. Emits ~10 KB of Bitcoin Script with 67 conditional hash chain loops. Uses the same `emitOp` pattern as other builtins.
- **SLH-DSA** (`verifySLHDSA_SHA2_*`): In separate module `slh-dsa-codegen.ts`. Emits 200-900 KB of Bitcoin Script depending on parameter set. Uses a `SLHTracker` class to manage named stack positions across ~2,100 tweakable hash operations. Each hash uses a dynamically-constructed 22-byte ADRS for domain separation.

The SLH-DSA codegen is replicated across all three compilers:
- TypeScript: `packages/tsop-compiler/src/passes/slh-dsa-codegen.ts`
- Go: `compilers/go/codegen/slh_dsa.go`
- Rust: `compilers/rust/src/codegen/slh_dsa.rs`

All three produce byte-identical Bitcoin Script, verified by the conformance suite.

---

## Optimizer

The optimizer runs after Pass 5 (Stack Lower) and before Pass 6 (Emit). It consists of two components in `packages/tsop-compiler/src/optimizer/`:

### Peephole Optimizer (`peephole.ts`)

Pattern-matches on sequences of Stack IR instructions and replaces them with shorter equivalents:

| Pattern | Replacement | Savings |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `EQUAL + VERIFY` | `OP_EQUALVERIFY` | 1 byte |
| `NUMEQUAL + VERIFY` | `OP_NUMEQUALVERIFY` | 1 byte |
| `CHECKSIG + VERIFY` | `OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY` | 1 byte |
| `SWAP + DROP` | `NIP` | 1 byte |
| `PUSH_INT(0) + ADD` | (removed) | 2+ bytes |
| `NOT + NOT` | (removed) | 2 bytes |

### Constant Folder (`constant-fold.ts`)

Evaluates constant expressions at compile time. For example, `3n + 4n` is folded to `7n` and emitted as a single `OP_7` instead of `OP_3 OP_4 OP_ADD`.

---

## Artifact Format

The final output of compilation is a JSON artifact (specified in `spec/artifact-format.md`). It contains everything needed to deploy and interact with the contract:

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "compilerVersion": "0.1.0",
  "contractName": "P2PKH",
  "abi": {
    "constructor": { "params": [{ "name": "pubKeyHash", "type": "Addr" }] },
    "methods": [{ "name": "unlock", "params": [...], "index": 0 }]
  },
  "script": "76a914<pubKeyHash>88ac",
  "asm": "OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <pubKeyHash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG",
  "sourceMap": { "file": "P2PKH.ts", "mappings": [...] },
  "stateFields": [],
  "buildTimestamp": "2025-06-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

Key fields: `script` (hex template with `<param>` placeholders), `asm` (human-readable opcodes), `abi` (method signatures for the SDK), `stateFields` (mutable property descriptors for stateful contracts).

---

## Multi-Compiler Strategy

TSOP defines a canonical IR conformance boundary at the ANF level. Any compiler that produces byte-identical ANF IR (serialized via RFC 8785) for a given source file is conformant.

| Compiler | Frontend | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| **TypeScript** (reference) | ts-morph | In progress |
| **Go** | tree-sitter | Planned |
| **Rust** | SWC | Planned |

All three compilers share the same ANF-to-Script pipeline (Passes 4-6) semantically. The Go and Rust compilers implement their own Passes 1-3 (parsing, validation, type-checking) using language-native tools, but must produce identical ANF IR.

### Why Multiple Compilers?

- **Go binary**: Integrates into existing BSV node infrastructure.
- **Rust binary**: Enables WASM compilation for in-browser contract authoring.
- **TypeScript**: Readable reference implementation and day-one production tool.

### Conformance Verification

The conformance suite in `conformance/` contains golden-file tests: source programs paired with expected ANF IR and expected script output. All compilers must pass the same suite. The SHA-256 of the canonical JSON output must match across all implementations.

```bash
pnpm run conformance:ts    # Test TypeScript compiler
pnpm run conformance:go    # Test Go compiler
pnpm run conformance:rust  # Test Rust compiler
```
